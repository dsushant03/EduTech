It is necessary to include all four parameters (err, req, res, next) in error-handling middleware functions, even if you don't use all of them. This is because Express identifies an error-handling middleware by the number of parameters it has. If a middleware has four parameters, Express treats it as an error-handling middleware, and it will be called when there is an error.

CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a security feature implemented by web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. This is a critical security mechanism to prevent malicious websites from making unauthorized requests to another domain on behalf of the user.

When a web page makes a request to a different domain (cross-origin request), the browser enforces the Same-Origin Policy, which restricts the request unless the target server explicitly allows it. CORS is the mechanism that allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources.

Origin: An origin is the combination of the protocol (e.g., http, https), domain, and port. For example, "https://www.example.com" and "http://api.example.com" are different origins.

Cross-Origin Request: When a web page at one origin makes a request to another origin (different domain), it's considered a cross-origin request.

e.g., if I make a post request from my react app (:3000) to my express app (:8080), it throws CORS error.

to get rid of this issue we have a package 'cors' which provides the middleware with same name (cors).
